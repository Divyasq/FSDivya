═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MODULE 1: BETTER SALES METRICS EDUCATION

Duration: 20 minutes
Difficulty: Beginner
Description: Understanding how Gross Sales, Net Sales, and Total Line Items are calculated and when they are reported

CORE METRIC DEFINITIONS

Gross Sales
• Formula: Price + Service Charges
• Description: The total amount charged to the customer before any deductions
• When Reported: When payment is completed
• Example: $100 item + $5 service charge = $105 Gross Sales

Net Sales
• Formula: Gross Sales - Discounts - Comps - Returns
• Description: Sales amount after deducting discounts, comps, and returns
• When Reported: When payment is completed
• Example: $105 Gross - $10 discount = $95 Net Sales

Total Line Item
• Formula: Net Sales - Partial Refunds + Tax
• Description: Final amount with tax adjustments
• When Reported: When payment is completed

SECTION 1: SALES METRICS DEFINITIONS
Content: Learn the fundamental definitions and formulas for key sales metrics used in Square reporting.

Example: Core Sales Metrics
• Scenario: Understanding the relationship between different sales metrics
• Calculation Steps:
  1. Gross Sales = Price + Service Charges (Total amount before deductions)
  2. Net Sales = Gross Sales - Discounts - Comps - Returns (Amount after deductions)
  3. Total Line Item = Net Sales - Partial Refunds + Tax (Final amount with tax adjustments)
• Result: These metrics build upon each other in sequence

SECTION 2: GROSS SALES
Content: Gross Sales = Price + Service Charges. This represents the total amount charged to customers before any deductions. It includes the base price of items plus any service charges.

Example: Basic Gross Sales
• Scenario: Customer orders a $25 meal with $3 delivery fee
• Calculation Steps:
  1. Item Price: $25.00 (Base price of the meal)
  2. Service Charges: $3.00 (Delivery fee)
  3. Gross Sales: $25.00 + $3.00 = $28.00 (Total before deductions)
• Result: $28.00

Interactive Calculator Available:
• Item Price input (default: $25.00)
• Service Charges input (default: $3.00)
• Automatic Gross Sales calculation

SECTION 3: NET SALES
Content: Net Sales = Gross Sales - Discounts - Comps - Returns. This is calculated by taking Gross Sales and subtracting discounts, comps (complimentary items), and returns.

Example: Net Sales with Discount
• Scenario: Customer has $28 gross sales with a $5 discount applied
• Calculation Steps:
  1. Gross Sales: $28.00 (Starting amount)
  2. Discounts: -$5.00 (Applied discount)
  3. Comps: $0.00 (No complimentary items)
  4. Returns: $0.00 (No returns)
  5. Net Sales: $28.00 - $5.00 = $23.00 (Final net amount)
• Result: $23.00

Interactive Calculator Available:
• Gross Sales input (default: $28.00)
• Discounts input (default: $5.00)
• Comps input (default: $0.00)
• Returns input (default: $0.00)
• Automatic Net Sales calculation

SECTION 4: TOTAL LINE ITEM
Content: Total Line Item = Net Sales - Partial Refunds + Tax. This is the final amount calculated as Net Sales minus partial refunds (refunds by amount) plus tax.

Example: Complete Calculation
• Scenario: Customer with $23 net sales, $2 partial refund, and $1.68 tax
• Calculation Steps:
  1. Net Sales: $23.00 (After discounts and comps)
  2. Partial Refunds: -$2.00 (Refund by amount)
  3. Tax: +$1.68 (Applied tax)
  4. Total Line Item: $23.00 - $2.00 + $1.68 = $22.68 (Final amount)
• Result: $22.68

Interactive Calculator Available:
• Net Sales input (default: $23.00)
• Partial Refunds input (default: $2.00)
• Tax input (default: $1.68)
• Automatic Total Line Item calculation

SECTION 5: WHEN METRICS ARE REPORTED
Content: Understanding when sales metrics are calculated and reported in your Square dashboard.

Example: Sales Metrics Reporting
• Scenario: All sales metrics follow the same reporting schedule
• Timing:
  1. Gross Sales: Reported when payment is completed (Payment completion triggers reporting)
  2. Net Sales: Reported when payment is completed (Same timing as Gross Sales)
  3. Total Line Item: Reported when payment is completed (Same timing as other sales metrics)
• Result: All sales metrics are reported simultaneously when payment completes

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - MODULE 1

Q: When are Gross/Net Sales reported?
A: All sales metrics (Gross Sales, Net Sales, Total Line Item) are calculated and reported when the payment is completed.
Examples:
• Payment completion triggers metric calculation
• Pending payments do not affect sales metrics
• All sales metrics use the same reporting time

Q: What counts as service charges in Gross Sales?
A: Service charges include delivery fees, processing fees, convenience charges, and any additional fees beyond the base item price.
Examples:
• Delivery fee: $3.00
• Processing fee: $1.50
• Convenience charge: $2.00

Q: What are partial refunds in the Total Line Item calculation?
A: Partial refunds are refunds by amount (not full item returns). They reduce the Total Line Item but not the Net Sales.
Examples:
• $5 refund on a $20 item
• Refund for damaged portion of order
• Customer dissatisfaction adjustment

Q: What are comps in the Net Sales calculation?
A: Comps (complimentary items) are free items given to customers, which reduce the Net Sales amount.
Examples:
• Free appetizer
• Complimentary drink
• Manager comp for service issue

MODULE 2: UNDERSTANDING SALES AND PAYMENTS METRICS DIFFERENCES

Duration: 30 minutes
Difficulty: Intermediate
Description: Learn why sales and payment metrics can differ and when each is reported

SECTION 1: WHEN SALES VS PAYMENTS ARE REPORTED
Content: Understanding the fundamental difference in timing between sales and payment reporting.

Example: Sales vs Payments Reporting Timeline
• Scenario: Understanding when each metric is recorded
• Timing:
  1. Sales Metrics: When payment is completed (Reported when payment finishes processing successfully)
  2. Payment Metrics: When payment is initiated (Reported when payment starts with specific exceptions)
• Result: This timing difference creates discrepancies in your reports

SECTION 2: GENERAL PAYMENT SCENARIOS

Sale with Single Payment
• Scenario: Standard transaction with one payment method
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Payment completed time (When the payment finishes processing)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (except Gift Cards: payment complete, Bank Transfers: payment completed time)
• Result: Most common scenario with minimal timing differences

Credit Card Processing Delay
• Scenario: Unintentional delays due to server-side processing issues
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Payment completed time (When payment actually completes despite delays)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (When customer initially presented payment method)
• Result: Network latency or server delays can cause timing discrepancies

Cash Payment System Issue
• Scenario: Internal system failure affecting payment record timing
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Payment completed time (When cash payment is actually completed)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (when system recovers) (When system failure is resolved and record is created)
• Result: System failures can create gaps between sale and payment recording

SECTION 3: EDGE CASES AND SPECIAL PAYMENT METHODS

Pre-Authorization
• Scenario: Payments are reported when customer presents payment method, sales when payment completes
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Payment completed time (When payment is captured and sale completes)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (When customer presents card for authorization, except Gift Cards: payment complete, Bank Transfers: payment completed time)
• Result: May show differences when sales fall outside of midnight windows

Tipping on Paper Receipts
• Scenario: Open orders where payment method is presented after order creation
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: When order is created (Sale recorded when order is initially created)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (When customer presents card for payment, except Gift Cards: payment complete, Bank Transfers: payment completed time)
• Result: Used for paper receipts and open orders where payment happens after order creation

Offline Payments
• Scenario: Payments taken offline and synced later
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Bill/Order completed_at time (When seller took the payment offline)
  - Payment Timing: Auth time when payment comes back online (When offline payment syncs back to system)
• Result: Offline mode creates timing gaps when payments sync back online

ACH Payments
• Scenario: Bank transfer payments with processing delays
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Payment completed/Capture time (When ACH payment is completed)
  - Payment Timing: Payment completed/Capture time (Same as sale timing for ACH)
• Result: Both metrics align for ACH payments due to processing requirements

SECTION 4: COMPLEX PAYMENT SCENARIOS

Sale with Split Payments
• Scenario: Multiple payment methods for single sale
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: Last completed payment (Sale timing depends on when final payment completes)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (Each payment reports when customer presents payment method, except Gift Cards: payment complete, Bank Transfers: bankTransaction.completedAt)
• Result: Sale timing depends on final payment completion

Sale with Multiple Payments via Invoice
• Scenario: Invoice paid in multiple installments
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: When final payment is complete (Sale not recorded until invoice is fully paid)
  - Payment Timing: When customer presents payment method (Each payment reports when customer presents payment method, Gift Cards: when completed, Bank Transfers: when completed)
• Result: Sale not recorded until invoice is fully paid

House Account
• Scenario: Credit account payments
• Timing:
  - Sale Timing: When order is placed (Sale recorded immediately when order is created)
  - Payment Timing: As House account balances are paid (Payments recorded when account is settled)
• Result: Sale recorded immediately, payments recorded when account is settled

SECTION 5: UNDERSTANDING BANK TRANSFERS
Content: Deep dive into how bank transfers affect sales and payment reporting.

Example: Bank Transfer Timing Rules
• Scenario: How bank transfers are handled differently from other payment methods
• Comparison:
  1. Standard Payments: When customer presents payment method (Most payments report when customer presents payment method)
  2. Bank Transfers: Payment completed time (Bank transfers report when completed, aligning with sales timing)
  3. Why Different: Processing requirements (Bank transfers require completion confirmation before reporting)
• Result: Bank transfers align more closely with sales timing than other payment methods

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - MODULE 2

Q: Why do my sales and payment totals not match?
A: Sales are reported when payments complete, while payments are reported when initiated. Processing delays, offline payments, and different payment methods can create timing differences.
Examples:
• Credit card processing delays
• Offline payments syncing later
• Pre-authorization vs capture timing
• System failures affecting timing

Q: How do Square Gift Cards affect timing?
A: For Square Gift Cards, payments are reported at the payment complete time instead of the standard payment created time.
Examples:
• Gift card payments use capture intent timing
• Different from standard payment created time

Q: What happens with Bank Transfers?
A: Bank transfers report payments at the payment completed time, aligning more closely with sales timing. This is different from most other payment methods.
Examples:
• Bank transfers align payment and sales timing
• Use bankTransaction.completedAt for split payments

Q: What is the difference between Pre-Auth and Tipping on Paper Receipts?
A: Pre-Auth is when payments are reported when customer presents payment method and sales when payment completes, which may show differences when sales fall outside midnight windows. Tipping on Paper Receipts is for open orders where sales are reported when order is created and payments when customer presents payment method.
Examples:
• Pre-Auth: payment timing vs sales timing differences
• Paper Receipts: order creation vs payment presentation
• Both create intentional timing differences for different business needs

Q: How do offline payments affect reporting?
A: Offline payments create timing gaps because sales are recorded when taken offline, but payments are recorded when they sync back online.
Examples:
• Sale: when payment taken offline
• Payment: when synced back online
• Can create significant timing differences

Q: How do split payments affect sales timing?
A: For split payments, the sale is reported when the last payment completes, while each individual payment is reported at its own timing.
Examples:
• Sale waits for final payment
• Each payment reports individually
• Can create timing spreads across multiple payments

Q: Why do House Account sales and payments have different timing?
A: House Account sales are recorded immediately when the order is placed (extending credit), while payments are recorded when the account balance is actually paid.
Examples:
• Sale: immediate when order placed
• Payment: when account settled
• Reflects credit extension vs payment collection
